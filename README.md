# KMeans-Clustering-Find-K

The task is to perform customer segmentation using KMeans. We are interested in grouping our customers into groups based on similar characteristics. This can help the company effectively allocate marketing resources. We will use customer age, education, years of employment, income, debt, whether they defaulted, and their debt to income ratio to group them into segments.
